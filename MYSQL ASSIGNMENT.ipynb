    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to facilitate data management and retrieval for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that differ in their structure and approach to data management:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are defined by primary and foreign keys. SQL databases are ideal for applications where data is structured and requires complex querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that use a variety of data models to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are designed for applications that require scalability and flexibility in their data structures. NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making them ideal for big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases have a rigid, predefined data model based on tables, while NoSQL databases can have different data models such as key-value pairs, document-based, graph-based, or column-family based.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: NoSQL databases are more scalable than SQL databases because they can easily handle large volumes of data and are designed to work in distributed environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Querying: SQL databases use SQL to query data, while NoSQL databases use various APIs or query languages, depending on the data model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity rules, such as constraints and foreign keys, to ensure data consistency, while NoSQL databases do not enforce such rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ACID Compliance: SQL databases are generally ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, which ensures that data transactions are reliable and consistent, while NoSQL databases may or may not be ACID compliant."
